              <p>Rancho Cotate High School's Robotics Team is registered with FIRST®, a globally recognized organization. The mission of FIRST® is “to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.”</p>
              <br>
              <br>
                <p>
                  Rancho Cotate High School started its first-ever robotics team in 2022. Since then we have recruited 10 devoted members, competed in the global FIRST Robotics competition, and engaged in community events. Members of our FIRST Robotics team #9111 are mentored by 3 local industry professionals.
Our mission is not only to build robotics but to also embrace a community mindset. Our team is committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture of equity, diversity, and inclusion. Regardless of race, gender, and even technical background, we are open to any students who want to join in on growing the team.

              <h3>Design</h3>
                <p> We design our robot to meet challenge requirements in CAD with professional software like OnShape, SOLIDWORKS, and Autodesk. The design team is in charge of selecting parts and materials we need for the robot.

<h3>Programming</h3>
                <p> A big part of creating robots is the software that goes into the robot. Programmers will create and write code to control the robot’s logic and motion. No experience is necessary and this is a great chance to get real-world experience in programming. Even experienced programmers will still learn new things. The programming experience gained from Rancho’s Robotics team is useful to those who want to learn or build a career in Computer Science.

<h3>Mechanical</h3>
                <p> Within our robotics team, we use basic and advanced tools and create well-developed outlines for our projects. From CNC 3D printers, welders, mills, and lathes to table work and putting pieces together you will learn to efficiently and safely use tools and machines from mentors. We all work together to create a robot from the design phase to the build phase.

<h3>Electronics</h3>
                <p> You will learn the basic circuitry skills needed to make a robot. We will use electronics and sensors/modules to control and give life to our robot. Once again no prior experience is needed, this is a great place to start if you are interested in electrical engineering and want to learn more about how hardware works.
