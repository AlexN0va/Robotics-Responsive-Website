                <p>1 About FIRST
FIRST®, For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, is a non-profit organization dedicated to inspiring young people. Through programs such as the FIRST Robotics Competition and FIRST Lego League, students are emboldened to excel in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. FIRST was founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen (inventor of the Segway and the insulin pump) and has since become a large international organization reaching thousands of students from elementary school through high school.

1.1 About FRC
FRC, short for FIRST Robotics Competition, is FIRST’s oldest robotics program. It is designed to provide a rigorous engineering challenge to high school students as well as teach leadership, collaboration, and project management. Over three thousand teams contain anywhere from fewer than ten to over one hundred students with guidance and support from adult mentors. Each year, every FRC team builds a robot in the six-week "build season" to compete in a game released in early January and attended in mid-March.
