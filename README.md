### About
I have always wanted to make a website and this class gave me that opportunity. Though, as time passed I eventually gave into website builders which have also always fascinated me. This project gave me the opportunity to compare my HTML and CSS skills with those of a website builder. What I found was the beauty of HTML and CSS. Every CTRL-S was a step forward to creating a website that came from the HTML and CSS I learned. Having the control of creating pretty much everything came from that process of learning and ultimately that is something you cannot get out of a website builder. 

This website is meant to represent a template for a website for my robotics team. When creating this website I was able to think about our team colors and the general information that we want to share with our community.
